Recently, mobile services have been increasing rapidly.
Mobile devices and applications are built in different
platforms (e.g. Android, IOS or Windows Phone, etc.) which
required advanced knowledge for developing applications. To
overcome this issue, we introduce a framework that supports
users to easily adapt to various platforms without having
advanced knowledge. In addition, we integrate a Push
Message Service on the cloud into this framework, not only in
order to expand the variety of services to cloud users but also
provide more service types for user demands. Our framework
consists of both user interface design and application
deployment across multiple mobile platforms based on Apache
Cordova platform.
